# helloworld

Could be ignored as this is just me testing out the whole VSCode C++ plugin setup and pushes to remote Git repo.

If it helps all steps were followed from the below link:-
  https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp

Steps were clear and straighforward. But works best when you have admin rights. 
Not much to be done in this repo in the future except to test out some editor or git features.
